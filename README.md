#WElCOME TO LABEL LOVERS
###An app that helps you make spotify playlists based on the record labels you love!

To begin, fork this project and clone to your machine.

Then install all of the dependencies.
`yarn add`
OR
`npm install`

To start the developement server for the front-end.
`yarn dev`
OR
`npm run dev`

This will run a webpack-dev-server for the react code.

Then to serve the express files we must also run a nodemon server.

`yarn start:server`
OR
`npm run start:server`

Easy Peasy.
